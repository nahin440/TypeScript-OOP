# How TypeScript Enhances Code Quality and Project Maintainability  

TypeScript has become a game-changer in modern web development, offering powerful tools to improve code quality and maintainability. By introducing static typing, TypeScript helps catch errors during development—long before they reach production. This leads to more robust, predictable, and self-documenting code.  

## Key Benefits of TypeScript  

1. **Early Error Detection** – TypeScript checks types at compile time, reducing runtime errors.  
2. **Better Code Organization** – Interfaces and types enforce consistent data structures.  
3. **Improved Collaboration** – Clear type definitions make code easier to understand in team settings.  
4. **Enhanced IDE Support** – Autocompletion, refactoring tools, and inline documentation boost productivity.  

## Example: Union and Intersection Types  

Union (`|`) and intersection (`&`) types are powerful TypeScript features that allow flexible type composition.  

### **Union Types (`|`)**  
A union type allows a variable to hold values of multiple types.  

```typescript
type Status = "success" | "error" | "pending";  

function getStatusMessage(status: Status): string {  
    switch (status) {  
        case "success": return "Operation completed successfully!";  
        case "error": return "An error occurred.";  
        case "pending": return "Processing...";  
    }  
}  

console.log(getStatusMessage("success")); // Output: "Operation completed successfully!"  
```  

### **Intersection Types (`&`)**  
An intersection type combines multiple types into one.  

```typescript
interface User {  
    name: string;  
    age: number;  
}  

interface Admin {  
    permissions: string[];  
}  

type AdminUser = User & Admin;  

const superUser: AdminUser = {  
    name: "Alice",  
    age: 30,  
    permissions: ["create", "delete", "update"]  
};  

console.log(superUser); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 30, permissions: ["create", "delete", "update"] }  
```  

## Conclusion  

TypeScript’s static typing, combined with features like union and intersection types, significantly improves code reliability and maintainability. By enforcing type safety and providing better tooling, it helps developers write cleaner, more scalable applications.
